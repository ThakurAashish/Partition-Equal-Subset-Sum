# Partition-Equal-Subset-Sum
This problem checks whether a given array can be divided into two subsets with equal sum. First, the total sum of all elements is calculated. If the sum is odd, it is not possible to partition the array into two equal subsets. If the sum is even, the task reduces to finding a subset whose sum is equal to half of the total sum.
